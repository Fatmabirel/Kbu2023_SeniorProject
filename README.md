# FULL STACK WEB APPLICATION FOR CONTENT BASED PRODUCT RECOMMENDER SYSTEM


This study describes the development of a comprehensive full-stack web application that provides product recommendations based on product data gathered from five different markets. 
Aim of this project is providing faster and simpler access to cheapest product, product with the lowest unit price and trended products information for end-users.


In this comprehensive study, our primary objective is to develop a robust full-stack web
application that efficiently searches multiple online markets, skilfully scrapes valuable
product data, and utilizes the accumulated information to generate continuous
recommendations of the most cost-effective products for users. It is worth noting that
numerous existing applications serve a similar purpose across the vast realm of the internet.
Hence, it becomes imperative to meticulously evaluate the performance of our meticulously
crafted application in comparison to renowned websites such as "akak√ße.com" and
"cimri.com".

In this repository, our aim is to collect data from websites with PHP programming languages. The process of accessing "valuable", "meaningful" and "useful" information
that will meet our needs from a large mass of data is called "Data Mining". In this obtained data, "noise", which is called unwanted information, is removed, and made
ready for transformation. In this project, PHP programming language, which hasmade a name for itself in the web world, will be used for Data Mining. PHP is
especially used for developing web applications and creating dynamic web pages.When it comes to PHP and data mining, the first thing that comes to mind is the curl () function. The curl () function, known as Client URL, is a very important function for data transfer in PHP. PHP curl () function helps us to obtain data,
analyze data and archive data. In our project, it will be used to obtain information about the desired product from e-marketplace platforms. Curl () will be used to obtain data such as reviews, price information, comments, and evaluations about the product from the target e-marketplace platform.

For this purpose, in the project;

a) Comparing the price of the product and sorting accordingly.

b) If a product is sold in multiples, determine the unit price of the product, and
compare it with the single price of the same product.

c) Compare the number of reviews on the product with data from all emarketplace sites.

d) Compare the number of reviews about the product.

e) Compare the estimated delivery date of the product to the cargo and sort accordingly when necessary.

f) Compare the product rating about the product and adjust accordingly if necessary, sorting.

g) Creating a price analysis graph about the product if sufficient information is available information such as the data are expected to be obtained as a result of
the data analysis.
